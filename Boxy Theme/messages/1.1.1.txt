üì£ BREAKING CHANGES IN 2.0.0: MEET BOXY!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Due to unrelated meaning of OTTO in some languages I've been forced to change
the theme name. Starting from now otto is BOXY! It's short, memorable and
inspired by gift boxes.


Versioning & Deprecation
------------------------

There will be no 2.0.0 release of OTTO, instead it will be released as
BOXY 2.0.0.

Existing versions of OTTO will be left working until next release.
But you can also install them manually anytime.

Troubleshooting
------------------------

You will need to reinstall theme when Boxy 2.0.0 will be released because it
requires hard references for different stuff.

I recommend you:
1. Install `BOXY` manually before it will be released:
   https://github.com/ihodev/sublime-boxy/wiki/Get-It
2. Review your settings: https://github.com/ihodev/sublime-boxy/wiki/Settings
3. Install via Package Control when BOXY 2.0.0 will be available.

The easiest way to reinstall is using Sublime Package Control, where BOXY is
listed as `Boxy Theme`.

1. Activate default Sublime Text color scheme using menu item
   `Preferences -> Color Scheme -> Color Scheme - Default -> Monokai Bright`
2. Open Command Palette using menu item `Tools -> Command Palette...`
3. Choose `Package Control: Remove Package`
4. Find `Theme - Otto` and hit `Enter`
5. Choose `Package Control: Install Package`
6. Find `Boxy Theme` and hit `Enter`
7. Review your settings and activation.


Settings
------------------------

Please, review all your theme options after update:
https://github.com/ihodev/sublime-boxy/wiki/Settings

Almost all of them were already reviewed in 2.0.0.


I'm sorry
